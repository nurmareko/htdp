; A TrafficLight is one of the following Strings:
; – "red"
; – "green"
; – "yellow"
; interpretation the three strings represent the three 
; possible states that a traffic light may assume 

; TrafficLight -> TrafficLight
; yields the next state, given current state cs
(define (tl-next cs) cs)

; TrafficLight -> Image
; renders the current state cs as an image
(define (tl-render current-state)

; TrafficLight -> TrafficLight
; simulates a clock-based American traffic light
