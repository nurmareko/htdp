Exercise 88. Define a structure type that keeps track of the cat’s
x-coordinate and its happiness. Then formulate a data definition for
cats, dubbed VCat, including an interpretation. 

(define-struct vcat [x happiness])
; VCat is a structure:
;   (make-vcat Number Number)
; interpretation a point x pixels from left, and happines value
; between 0 and 100

Exercise 89. Design the happy-cat world program, which manages a walking
cat and its happiness level. Let’s assume that the cat starts out with
perfect happiness.

VCat -> VCat
; launches the progam from some initial state
(define (happy-cat cat)
  (big-bang cat
    [to-draw ...]
    [on-tick ...]))

; VCat -> Image
; when needed, big-bang obtains the image of the current 
; state of the world by evaluating (render cat) 
(define (render cat) ...)

; VCat -> VCat
; for each tick of the clock, big-bang obtains the next 
; state of the world from (walk cat) 
(define (walk cat) ...)
