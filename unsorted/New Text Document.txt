Exercise 51. Design a big-bang program that simulates
a traffic light for a given duration. The program renders
the state of a traffic light as a solid circle of the
appropriate color, and it changes state on every clock
tick. Hint Read the documentation for big-bang; there is
a reason all these “words” are linked to their
documentation. What is the most appropriate initial state?
Ask your engineering friends.

; A TrafficLight is one of the following Strings:
; – "red"
; – "green"
; – "yellow"
; interpretation the three strings represent the three 
; possible states that a traffic light may assume 

TraffictLight -> Image
create a solid circle of the appropriate color base on
TrafficLight state
(define (render tl) Image)

TrafficLight -> TrafficLight 
determine what color should be the next state of TrafficLight
(define (next-light s) "red")
