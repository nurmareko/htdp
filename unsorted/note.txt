Define one function per task.

For every constant mentioned in a problem statement, introduce one
constant definition.

what does the function compute?

data example

A data definition serves two purposes. First, it names a collection of
data—a class—using a meaningful word. Second,Computing scientists use
“class” to mean something like a “mathematical set.” it informs readers
how to create elements of this class and how to decide whether some
arbitrary piece of data belongs to the collection.

A position on a world canvas is uniquely identified by two pieces of
data: the distance from the left margin and the distance from the top
margin. The first is called an x-coordinate and the second one is the
y-coordinate.

; distances in terms of pixels:
(define HEIGHT 200)
(define MIDDLE (quotient HEIGHT 2))
(define WIDTH  400)
(define CENTER (quotient WIDTH 2))

For structure types, this calls for a description of what kind of data
goes into which field.

; Posn -> Image
; adds a red spot to MTS at p
(define (scene+dot p) MTS)
Adding a purpose statement is straightforward. As Designing Functions
mentions, it uses the function’s parameter to express what the function
computes.

Note Functions such as posn-up-x are often called updaters or functional
setters. They are extremely useful when you write large programs. 

If a function deals with nested structures, develop one function per level
of nesting.

Defining enumerations and intervals means distinguishing among different
kinds of elements. To distinguish in code requires conditional functions.

Every time we say “piece of information,” we don’t necessarily mean a
single number or a single word. A piece of information may itself combine
several pieces of information. Creating a data representation for that
kind of information naturally leads to nested structures.
