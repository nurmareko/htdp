Exercise 81. Design the function time->seconds, which consumes instances
of time structures (see exercise 77) and produces the number of seconds
that have passed since midnight. For example, if you are representing 12
hours, 30 minutes, and 2 seconds with one of these structures and if you
then apply time->seconds to this instance, the correct result is 45002.

(define-struct time [hour minute second])
; Time is (make-time Number Number Number)
(define ex1 (make-time 12 30 2))
(define ex1 (make-time 2 80 100))

; Time -> Number
; convert t to time in seconds
(define (time->seconds t) 0)

(check-expect (time->seconds ex1) 45002)
(check-expect (time->seconds ex2) 12100)

(define (time->seconds t)
  (... (time-hour t) ... (time-minute t) ... (time-second t) ...))

(define (time-seconds t)
  (+ (* 60 (+ (* 60 (time-hour t)) (time-minute t))) (time-second t)))
