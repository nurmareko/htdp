;Exercise 37. Design the function string-rest, which
;produces a string like the given one with the first
;character removed.

; use String to producea string with the first
; character removed.

; consume a String and produce a String:
; String -> String
; calculate s String and remove sub-string at positon 0 to produce "x‚Äù.
; (define (f s) "x")

; given:
;     "good night"
; expected:
;     "ood night"
; given:
;     " james"
; expected:
;     "james"

(define (string-rest s)
 	(substring s 1))

(string-rest " james")
