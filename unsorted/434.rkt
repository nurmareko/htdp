; when the given first argument is a list of numbers
; that equal to or smaller than the second argument,
; the function will return the exact same problem
; as its first argument.
; because the problem is not getting smaller,
; it will cause a loops, the quick-sort< algorithm
; will not terminate.

; example:
;   (smallers '(11 9 2) 11)
;    ==
;    '(11 9 2)
